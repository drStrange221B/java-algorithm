Linked List:

1) Linked List are List Data Structures, They can store multiple elements as a List.
2) Each Element is Linked to or point to the Next Element, the Elements are chained together.
3) ArrayList is the most common but LinkedList is also available to use as part of the standard java libraries.
4) The way to access LinkedList is via the very first Element in the List called the "HEAD".
5) Each element references to the next element in the chain, the last element points to NULL.


6) LinkedList consist of Head Node instance pointing null value and bunch of helper api
7) Node class has Data and reference of the next node and bunch of getters and setters;


8) adding Element at last is O(N).
9) deleting end element is O(N).
10) adding element at head/top is constant time O(1).
11) deleting element at head/top is constant time O(1)
12) counting with traversal is O(N) but it can be made at constant time if we have size variable.
